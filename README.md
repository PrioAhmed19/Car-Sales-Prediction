This project predicts car sales based on customer attributes using a deep learning model. It preprocesses synthetic car purchasing data obtained from Kaggle, applies feature scaling, and trains a neural network for accurate predictions.

Features
✅ Data Preprocessing – Handles missing values and removes unnecessary columns.
✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Visualizes data relationships using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
✅ Feature Scaling – Uses Min-Max Scaling for better model performance.
✅ Deep Learning Model – Implements a multi-layer neural network with Keras.
✅ Train/Test Split – Evaluates model performance using Scikit-learn.

Technologies Used:
**Python
Pandas, NumPy, Scipy
Seaborn, Matplotlib
